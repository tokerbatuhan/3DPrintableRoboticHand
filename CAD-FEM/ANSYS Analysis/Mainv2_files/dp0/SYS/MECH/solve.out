 The Distributed Sparse Matrix Solver is currently running in the        
 in-core memory mode.  This memory mode uses the most amount of memory   
 in order to avoid using the hard drive as much as possible, which most  
 often results in the fastest solution time.  This mode is recommended   
 if enough physical memory is present to accommodate all of the solver   
 data.

 There is at least 1 small equation solver pivot term (e.g., at the UZ   
 degree of freedom of node 604) which may indicate a numerically         
 unstable model.  Please check your results carefully.                   

 *** ERROR ***                           CP =      15.234   TIME= 00:20:49
 The value of UY at node 338 is 1.118967604E+10.  It is greater than the 
 current limit of 1000000 (which can be reset on the NCNV command).      
 This generally indicates rigid body motion as a result of an            
 unconstrained model.  Verify that your model is properly constrained.

 *** MESSAGE CONTINUATION ---- DIAGNOSTIC INFORMATION ***                
 If one or more parts of the model are held together only by contact     
 verify that the contact surfaces are closed.  Also make sure that       
 there are constraints (or friction) in the sliding direction even if    
 no load is applied in that direction.  You can use the CNCHECK command  
 to check the initial contact status in the SOLUTION module.
