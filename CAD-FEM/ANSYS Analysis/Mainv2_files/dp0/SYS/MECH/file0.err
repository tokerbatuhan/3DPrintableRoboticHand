/COM,ANSYS RELEASE Release 18.2      BUILD 18.2      UP20170726       00:20:35

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       1.500   TIME= 00:20:37
 Using 1 iteration per substep may result in unconverged solutions for   
 nonlinear analysis and the program may not indicate divergence in this  
 case.  Check your results.                                              

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       1.531   TIME= 00:20:37
 Element shape checking is currently inactive.  Issue SHPP,ON or         
 SHPP,WARN to reactivate, if desired.                                    

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       1.594   TIME= 00:20:37
 The preconditioned conjugate gradient solver (EQSLV,PCG command) only   
 works for fully constrained model.  There are less than 3 constraints   
 in the current model.  The solver has been reset to sparse              
 (EQSLV,SPARSE).                                                         

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       1.938   TIME= 00:20:37
 Material number 243 (used by element 49830 ) should normally have at    
 least one MP or one TB type command associated with it.  Output of      
 energy by material may not be available.                                

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       1.938   TIME= 00:20:37
 No constraints have been defined using the D command.                   

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =      15.109   TIME= 00:20:49
 There is at least 1 small equation solver pivot term (e.g., at the UZ   
 degree of freedom of node 604) which may indicate a numerically         
 unstable model.  Please check your results carefully.                   

 *** ERROR ***                           CP =      15.234   TIME= 00:20:49
 The value of UY at node 338 is 1.118967604E+10.  It is greater than the 
 current limit of 1000000 (which can be reset on the NCNV command).      
 This generally indicates rigid body motion as a result of an            
 unconstrained model.  Verify that your model is properly constrained.   

 *** ERROR ***                           CP =      15.234   TIME= 00:20:49
 *** MESSAGE CONTINUATION ---- DIAGNOSTIC INFORMATION ***                
 If one or more parts of the model are held together only by contact     
 verify that the contact surfaces are closed.  Also make sure that       
 there are constraints (or friction) in the sliding direction even if    
 no load is applied in that direction.  You can use the CNCHECK command  
 to check the initial contact status in the SOLUTION module.
