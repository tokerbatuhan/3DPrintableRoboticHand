A new design of a passive hand prosthetic is developed for toddlers. This design aims
to give amputee toddlers to have a prosthetic with a low-mass and easy control design, with
consideration of cosmesis. Passive type of prosthetic developed to meet low-mass
requirement. Finger design is developed to increase interaction surface in the action, by
giving flexibility to finger design to mimic normal human finger. A mathematical model has
been built to develop the mechanism. This mathematical algorithm would be used for
providing personal designs for different usage of areas in terms of rigidity of finger, pinch
force, material type. Grasping mechanism in this design allows the amputee to take
advantages of both voluntary opening and voluntary closing mechanisms.
